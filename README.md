This projects gives the compararive analysis of Hospital Management system using Splay Tree and Vanilla Tree (BST).

**Data Structure Used (C programming Language):**
- Vanilla Tree
- Splay Tree

**Applications:**
1. Add new patients
2. Maintain the contact details, ID of patients
3. Discharge of patients
4. Search for a patient
5. Display all patients details stored in the database
6. Display the most recently searched patient

**Conclusion:**
- Splay tree allow a very fast lookup of the nodes that have been previously accessed by the user which gives better performance.
- Splay tree is the fastest type of BST in practical application than other binary search trees like AVL, Red-Black tree.
- Easy for implementation .
-  No extra information is stored unlike AVL and Red-Black trees.
